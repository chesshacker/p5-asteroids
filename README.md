# Learn p5 by making the ship from Asteroids

I originally created this activity for use at the [2017 Youth Code Jam][jam],
but I am glad to share it with anyone who finds it helpful in learning or
teaching JavaScript. Use it however you like.

For the Code Jam event, we had the students edit the code using
[CodePen][codepen]. This is a great tool for teaching because the only thing
someone needs to get started is a web browser.

We used the [p5.js][p5] JavaScript library to teach students how to draw as they
began to recreate [Asteroids][asteroids], a classic game game Atari.

You can [use CodePen to try out this challenge][challenge]. Or skip straight to
[my solution][solution] to see what the final product might look like in
CodePen. Code for both the challenge and solution are included in this git repo.

Controls: To start flying, click in the window with the ship. Then use the up, left,
and right arrows to fly. The space bar shoots.
